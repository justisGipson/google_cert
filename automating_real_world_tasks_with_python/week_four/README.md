## Module 4 Introduction

Great job, you've made it to the final module! You’ve come so far! Can you believe how much you’ve learned?

In the past few modules, you've seen how you can modify images using Python Imaging Library; how you can interact
with web services using the Python requests module, sending data in JSON format; how you can generate PDF files with
the content you want; and how you can send emails with those PDFs as an attachment. 

For the final project in this course, you’ll use the techniques and concepts you've seen to build a solution to a
complex IT task. This can seem a bit daunting at first, but don't worry, you already have all the tools to solve this
task!

In the next couple of readings, we're going to get into what to expect, and some things you should keep in mind when
writing your solution.

### Project Problem Statement

Okay, here's the scenario:

You work for an online fruit store, and you need to develop a system that will update the catalog information with
data provided by your suppliers. When each supplier has new products for your store, they give you an image and a
description of each product.

Given a bunch of images and descriptions of each of the new products, you’ll:

* Upload the new products to your online store. Images and descriptions should be uploaded separately, using two
different web endpoints.

* Send a report back to the supplier, letting them know what you imported.

Since this process is key to your business's success, you need to make sure that it keeps running! So, you’ll also:

* Run a script on your web server to monitor system health.

* Send an email with an alert if the server is ever unhealthy.

Hopefully this summary has helped you start thinking about how you’ll approach this task. In case you’re feeling a
little scared, don't worry, you can definitely do this! You have all the necessary tools, and the lab description
will go into a lot more detail of what you need to do.

### How to Approach the Problem


We're giving you a pretty big project to do at the end of this course -- but you can totally complete it with what
you've learned until now! Take your time, and be methodical. Use these tips to help you:

___Break the problem down into smaller pieces___. If you’re not sure how to solve a piece of the puzzle, look for an
 even smaller piece that you can solve. Build up those smaller pieces into a larger solution!

___Make one change at a time___. Write unit tests to make sure that each new part of the solution works the way you
think it does. Run your unit tests frequently to make sure that each part of your solution **keeps working** as you
make changes.

___Use version control___. Check each part of your solution into version control as you complete it, so you can always
roll back to a known version of your code if you make a mistake.

___Review module documentation___! You are going to need to use these modules to complete the final project. Reading
the documentation takes time, but as you become more familiar with the APIs provided by these modules, it could save
you from writing a bunch of custom code that could have just been a call to a module function! Remember, we’ve covered
these modules in previous lessons too, so feel free to go back and review them if you need a refresher!
