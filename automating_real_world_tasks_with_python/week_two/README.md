# Automating Real-World Tasks with Python - Week 2

### Intro

Remember that putting your Python skills to practice with exercises like this one is the way to getting the hang of
it all. By practicing solving complex challenges, you'll become a lot more confident in your programming abilities
, and you'll be able to achieve a lot more.

In this module, we'll look into a bunch of different tools that can be really useful in today's IT world. You'll
first learn how you can use different text formats to store data in text files, retrieve it, and even transmit it
over the internet.

Later on, we'll look into how we can get our code to interact with services running on different computers using a
module called Python Requests.

We'll see a bunch of different examples and give you pointers to more information. Don't forget that the best way to
get comfortable with all these modules and libraries is to come up with your own examples and practice writing
scripts on your local computer!


## Learning Objectives

Look into different tools that can be really useful in today's IT world by:

* Learning how you can use different text formats to store data in text files, retrieve it, and even transmit it over the internet
* Learning how we can get our code to interact with services running on different computers using a module called Python Requests

## Web Applications and Services


### Web Applications and Services (sub)

A **web application** is an application that you interact with over HTTP. Most of the time when you’re using a website on the Internet, you’re interacting with a web application.

A **web service** is a web applications that have an API.

* Instead of browsing to a web page to type and click around, you can use your program to send a message known as an **API call** to the web service's API endpoints.

---

### Data Serialization

**Data serialization** is the process of taking an in-memory data structure, like a Python object, and turning it
into something that can be stored on disk or transmitted across a network. (ex: CSV file)

Turning the serialized object back into an in-memory object is called **deserialization**.

A web service's API endpoint can take messages in a specific format, containing specific data such as serialized data.

---

### Data Serialization Formats

There are different data serialization formats:

* **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)**

* **Yet Another Markup Language (YAML)**

* **Python pickle**

* **Protocol Buffers**

* **eXtensible Markup Language (XML)**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the serialization format that is used widely today in IT.

Below code uses the ```json.dump()``` function to serialize the people object into a JSON file.

```Python

import json

with open('people.json', 'w') as people_json:
    json.dump(people, people_json, indent=2)

```

Below is output of the ```json.dump()```

```JSON

[
  {
    "name": "Sabrina Green",
    "username": "sgreen",
    "phone": {
      "office": "802-867-5309",
      "cell": "802-867-5310"
    },
    "department": "IT Infrastructure",
    "role": "Systems Administrator"
  },
  {
    "name": "Eli Jones",
    "username": "ejones",
    "phone": {
      "office": "684-348-1127"
    },
    "department": "IT Infrastructure",
    "role": "IT Specialist"
  },
]

```

### More About JSON

Characteristics of JSON includes:

* JSON is human-readable

* JSON elements are always comma-delimited

JSON supports a few elements of different data types such as:

* Strings

* Numbers

* Objects

* Key-Value pair

* Arrays - arrays can contain strings, numbers, objects, or other arrays

```JSON
[
  "apple",
  "banana",
  12345,
  67890,
  {
    "name": "Sabrina Green",
    "username": "sgreen",
    "phone": {
      "office": "802-867-5309",
      "cell": "802-867-5310"
    },
    "department": "IT Infrastructure",
    "role": "Systems Administrator"
  }
]
```

## Python Requests


### The Python Requests Library

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the protocol of the world-wide web
