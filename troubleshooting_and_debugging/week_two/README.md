# Troubleshooting and Debugging Techniques - Week 2

Rundown of the different reasons that can make things run slowly by looking into:

* what causes slow scripts, slow computers, or slow systems

* what tools are there to help identify the most common causes of slowness, and apply solutions to improve the
 overall performance

## Understanding Slowness

### Why is my computer slow

The general strategy for addressing slowness is to **identify the bottleneck** for addressing slowness in  device, script, or system to run slowly. 

Some of the reasons could be:

* Running out of the CPU time

* Time spent reading data from disk waiting for data transmitted over the network

* Moving data from disk to RAM


Treat each part of the computer (CPU, memory, disk, network bandwidth) as **finite resources**.

Identifying the bottleneck allows us to manage the available resources more effectively. In order to find what is causing the bottleneck, **monitor** the usage of resources to know which of them are being exhausted.

We can use the following commands on Linux to monitor the usage of resources:

* **top** command on shows:
  * Which currently running processes are using the most CPU time
  * Which currently running processes are using the most memory
  * Other load information related to the current state of the computer such as how many processes are running and how the CPU time or memory is being used
  
* **iotop** command shows which processes are currently using the most disk IO usage and swap memory usage
* **iftop** command shows which processes are currently using the most network bandwidth

Therefore, steps to diagnose what's causing the computer to run slow would be:

1. Open one of above tools to check what's going on

2. Try to understand which resources the bottleneck and why

3. Plan how you're going to solve the issue


### How Computer Use Resources

When thinking about making things faster, it's important to understand the different speeds of the parts involved when accessing data/variables:

```(slowest) data from the newtok <- data from disk <- data from RAM <- data from CPU's inernal memory (fastest)```

Create a **cache** when the same files are read from disk repeatedly by putting the same information directly into the process memory and avoid loading it from disk every time. A cache stores data in a form that's faster to access than its original form.

Examples of caches in IT includes:

* Web proxy - stores websites, images, or videos that are accessed often by users behind the proxy

* DNS - implements a local cache for the websites they resolve so they don't need to query from the internet every time someone asks for their IP address

The operating system performs **swap** when there is not enough memory - the operating system will put the parts of
 the memory that aren't currently in use onto the hard drive in a space called swap. Reading and writing from disk is
  much slower than reading and writing from RAM. So when the swapped out memory is requested by an application, it
   will take a while to load it back. 
   
Swapping implementation varies between different OS, but same concept.
 
So what do you do if you find that your machine is slow because it's spending a lot of time swapping?

There are three possible reasons computer slows down due to constant swapping:

1. There are too many open applications
   * Solve by closing the ones that aren't needed
   
2. The available memory is too small for the amount that computer is using
   * Solve by add more RAM to the computer
   
3. One of the running programs may have a **memory leak**, causing it to take all the available memory
   * A memory leak means that memory which is no longer needed is not getting released


### Possible Causes for Slowness

Below are some of the possible causes for slowness:

* Too many applications are configured to start on a boot and the computer slows at start up
  * Solve by disabling applications that aren't really needed on a startup

* Computer slows after days of running and the problem solved by a reboot - an application keeps some state while running and takes the memory
  * Solve by modifying the code to frees up the memory after using it
  * If it can't be fixed, fix by scheduling a restart

* Computer slows after days of running and the problem isn't solved by a reboot - the files that an application handles grown too large
  * Solve by modifying the code to handle the large file - bug fix
  * If it can't be fixed, try to **reduce** the size of the files involved - **sharding**

* Only a subset of computer is slow
  * Check if there is any difference in configuration

* Computer slows due to a lot of reads and writes on the network-mounted file system
  * Solve by creating a cache
 
* Hardware failures

* Malicious software


### Slow Web Server

```Client complains about a web site loading slow```

First, reproduce the case and quantify the slowness with a tool called ```ab``` which stands for **Apache Benchmark** tool. ```ab``` checks if a website is behaving as expected or not by making a bunch of requests and summarize the results once it's done.

Below command gets the average timing of 500 requests, and then pass site.example.com for the measurement:

```Shell
ab -n 500 site.example.com
```

Next, connect to the web server with ```ssh```

```Shell
ssh SERVERNAME
```

Start by looking at the output of ```top``` and see if there's possible cause.

For this scenario:

* ```top``` output shows that the load average is around 30
  * The load average on Linux shows how much time the processor is busy at a given minute
  * For a single core processor with any number above 1 and a dual core processor with any number 2 is being **overloaded**
  * 30 means that there were more processes waiting for processor time than the processor had to give
  
* There are multiple ```ffmpeg``` processes running which uses all of the available CPU
  * ```ffmpeg``` program is used for video transcoding and a CPU intensive process

At this point, one thing we can try is to **change the processes priorities** so that the web server takes precedence which can be done with the following commands:

* ```nice``` command for starting a process with a different priority
* ```renice``` command for changing the priority of a process that's already running

Since there are multiple ffmpeg processes running, let's change priority of all of ```ffmpeg``` at once instead of
 running ```renice``` one by one with the following shell script:

```Shell
for pid in $(pidof ffmpeg); do renice 19; $pid; done
```

Above shell script:

1. Iterates over the output of the ```pidof``` command with a for loop
   * ```pidof``` command receives the process name and returns all the process IDs that have that name
   
2. Calls ```renice``` for each of the process IDs
   * ```renice``` takes the new priority which is 19, the lowest possible priority, as the first argument, and the process ID to change as the second one

Check if the problem has been solved by running ```ab```. **For this scenario, the website is still slow.**

Transcoding processes are CPU intensive, and running them in **parallel** is overloading the computer. So one thing we could do is, modify the program to run the transcoding one at a time instead of all at the same time.

To do that, we'll need to find out how these processes got started:

1. Look at the output of the ```ps``` command to get some more information about the processes
2. Call ```ps ax``` which shows us all the running processes on the computer, and connect the output of the command to ```less``` to be able to scroll through it

```Shell
ps ax | less

#search for ffmpeg from the output of ps using / which is the search key when using less
/ffmpeg
```

Upon search, it shows that

* There are multiple ffmpeg processes that are converting videos from the webm format to the mp4 format in static
* We don't know where these videos are on the hard drive

Use ```locate``` command to locate the file.

```Shell
locate static/001.webm

#locate command returns the following
/srv/deploy_videos/static/001.webm
```

When there are multiple files, use ```grep``` command to check if any of the files contain a call to a searching term - in this case ```ffmpeg``` instead of checking them one by one.

```Shell
grep ffmpeg *
```

The output of grep shows that ```deploy.sh``` script starts the ```ffmpeg``` processes in parallel using a tool called ```Daemonize``` that runs each program separately as if it were a daemon - address the issue.

**However, modifying the script does NOT change the processes that are already running.**

**Also we want to stop these processes but not cancel them completely**, as doing so would mean that the videos being converted right now will be incomplete.

To avoid canceling the processes, use the ```killall``` command with the ```-STOP``` flag which sends a stop signal but doesn't kill the processes completely.

```Shell
killall -STOP ffmpeg
```

After stopping them all, we now want to run these processes **one at a time**. This can be done by sending the ```CONT``` signal one by one after each process completes the task. This can be automated with the similar for loop used earlier.

```Shell
for pid in $(pidof ffmpeg); do while kill -CONT $pid; do sleep 1; done; done;
```

Check if the problem has been solved by running ```ab```. **For this scenario, the problem is fixed at this point.**

## Slow Code

### Writing Efficient Code

As a rule, aim first to write code that is to avoid bugs

* Readable
* Easy to maintain
* Easy to understand

If the code is not fast enough, tru to optimize by eliminating **expensive actions**, which are those that take a long time to complete.

* Trying to optimize every second out of a script is probably not worth the effort though

The first step is to keep in mind that we can't really make our computer go faster. If we want our code to finish faster, we need to make our computer do less work, and to do this, we'll have to 

1. Avoid doing work that isn't really needed
2. Avoid calculating data repeatedly by using the right data structures and storing the data
3. Reorganize the code so that the computer can stay busy while waiting for information from slow sources like disk or over the network

Use a **profiler** tool to measure the resources that the code is using for better understanding of what's going on. It allows us to see which functions are called by our program, how many times each function was called and how much time are programs spent on each of them.

Because of how profilers work, they are specific to each programming language

* C program uses gprof to analyze
* Python uses c-Profile module to analyze


### Using the Right Data Structures

Using an appropriate data structures can help us avoid unnecessary expensive operations and create efficient scripts.

**Lists** are sequences of elements that can

* Add, remove, or modify the elements in them
* Iterate through the whole list to operate on each of the elements

When adding or removing elements,

* Adding or removing elements **at the end** is fast
* Adding or removing elements in the middle can be slow because all the elements that follow need to be repositioned

When accessing or finding an element,

* Accessing an element in a specific position in the list is fast
* Accessing an element in an unknown position requires going through the whole list
  * This can be super slow if the list is long

**Dictionary** store key value pairs that can

* Add data by associating a value to a key
* Retrieve a value by looking up a specific key

When accessing or finding an element,

* Looking up keys is very fast O(n)

In summary,

* If you need to access elements by position or will always iterate through all the elements, use a list
* If we need to look up the elements using a key, use a dictionary

Another thing that we might want to think twice about is creating copies of the structures that we have in **memory**.


### Expensive Loops

When using a loop, avoid doing expensive actions inside of the loop. If an expensive operation is performed inside a loop, you multiply the time it takes to do the expensive operation by the amount of times you repeat the loop.

* Make sure that the list of elements that you're iterating through is only as long as you really need it to be
* Break out of the loop once the data is found

## When Slowness Problems Get Complex

### Parallelization Operations

Operating in **parallel** is one way to run scripts more efficiently.

* **Concurrency** is dedicated to how we write programs that do operations in parallel

When data needs to shared while using the OS to split the work and the processes, use **threads**.

* These processes don't share any memory by default

__Threads let us run parallel tasks inside a process__. This allows threads to share some of the memory with other threads in the same process.

To handle threads, modify the code to create and handle the thread.

* In Python, use the **Threading** or **AsyncIO** modules (each programming language hsa different implementations)

These modules let us specify which parts of the code we want to run in separate threads or as separate asynchronous events, and how we want the results of each to be combined in the end

If your script is mostly just waiting on input or output, also known as I/O bound, it might matter if it's executed on one processor or eight.
