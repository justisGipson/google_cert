## Managing Cloud Instance at Scale

In this module, you’ll learn all about storing data in the cloud. You’ll rundown the different types of storage
available, like-

* block storage 

* object storage

* and how they differ. 

You’ll explore load balancing further and dive into some load balancing techniques, like-

* **round-robin**

* **DNS**

* **sticky sessions** 

Next, you’ll dive into change management, including the different ways to test your changes and how to push
them. You’ll explore different testing methods, like-

* **unit tests**

* **integration tests**

You’ll also cover **continuous integration**, the use of **continuous deployment**, and how to apply **A/B testing**.
 
Next up, you’ll look at some errors you might encounter along the way, like **quotas** or **limits**, and how best to
avoid or prepare for these. 

In the next lesson, you’ll get an understanding of monitoring and altering, and review some
systems that offer it. You’ll then dive into the concept of **SLA**’s and how to set achievable ones. 

Next, you’ll look at basic monitoring in GCP, and create altering policies, set up conditions, and choose aggregators
to manage the data. 

Finally, will explore troubleshooting and debugging our systems. You’ll learn how to troubleshoot and debug remotely,
understand. Techniques for how to identify where the failure is coming from, and how to recover from a failure when
it strikes.
