#Standard Streams
# STDIN - the standard input stream which is a channel between a program and a source of input
# STDOUT - the standard output stream which is a pathway between a program and a target of output
# SDTERR - the standard error stream which displays output like standard out, but is used specifically as a channel to show error messages and diagnostics from the program

data = input("This comes from STDIN:")
