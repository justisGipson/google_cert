# Testing in Python

# ==========================================================================================

# Manual Testing
# Running the code via the interpreter to verify that we are getting the results that we want, before using it in our
# script.

# Automatic Testing
# Codifying our tests, so that they will run when our code does. Verifying that we will get the desired results.

# ==========================================================================================

# Unit Tests

# Unit tests are used to verify that small, isolated parts of a program are correct.
# Generally written alongside the code to test the behavior of individual pieces or units, like functions or methods.

# ==========================================================================================

# Edge Cases

# Edge cases are inputs to our code that produce unexpected results, and are found at the extreme ends of the ranges
# of input we imagine our programs will typically work with
